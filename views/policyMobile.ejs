		 <h3 style="color:#35BFD3;border-bottom:2px #35BFD3 dotted">Cancellation Policy</h3>
		 		 <p  style="text-align:justify;">
You may choose to cancel your subscription at any point of time if you deem our services unsatisfactory. We would however urge you to get in touch with us first with any complaints so that we can take your feedback and ensure corrective action to improve and hopefully change your mind. If this still does not satisfy you, the cancellation will stand effective from the following month. However, since we charge the monthly fee in advance, a refund will not be possible. While your investments will stay intact, you will not have access to any of the reports we offer. If you choose to sign up to our plans and reports following a hiatus, there will be a flat fee of Rs. 500 that will be charged under the Good Plan, Rs. 1500 under the Better Plan and Rs. 2000 under the Best Plan to meet our cost of maintenance of your account for the period.
